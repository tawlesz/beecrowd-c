/*
Read the four values corresponding to the x and y axes of two points in the plane, p1 (x1, y1) and p2 (x2, y2) and calculate the distance between them, showing four decimal places, according to the formula:

Distance =
Input

The input file contains two lines of data. The first one contains two double values: x1 y1 and the second one also contains two double values with one digit after the decimal point: x2 y2.
Output

Calculate and print the distance value using the provided formula, with 4 decimal places.
